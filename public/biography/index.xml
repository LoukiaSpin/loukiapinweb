      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;overview&#34;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aspired to study archaeology and ended up studying statistics. The journey theme was initial self-doubt and ‘what the heck I was thinking’ on repeat mode, followed by zero regrets and many surprises. I got some hints that statistics would be my calling during my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s studies at the University of Piraeus (Department of Statistics and Insurance Science). By the end of my studies, I was determined to pursue a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Biostatistics, which I did at the same University and Department. Afterwards, and with the encouragement of my Master&amp;rsquo;s supervisor (because the self-doubt emerged once again), I moved to Ioannina to pursue my PhD Studies at the School of Medicine (Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology). Little did I know that this step would be the springboard for my career as a researcher and more surprises to follow. I was introduced to evidence synthesis, particularly the network meta-analysis framework. I cannot remember what I found more intriguing: the network meta-analysis or the Bayesian framework. My research revolved around (aggregate) missing participant outcome data in network meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Publications, international collaborations, journal clubs and presentations in conferences filled my experience canvas with unprecedented colours and set the foundation for my next big step: my relocation to Germany as a postdoctoral researcher. Of course, my &amp;lsquo;buddy&amp;rsquo;, self-doubt, relocated with me there. And, yes, ‘what the heck I was thinking’ was the initial theme on repeat mode, again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatdozent&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Privatdozentin&lt;/a&gt; and principal investigator in evidence synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
