bio: My research interests include developing and evaluating methods for pairwise and network meta-analysis      using aggregate data, and working on the rnmamod R package.

I aspired to study archaeology and ended up studying statistics. The journey theme was initial self-doubt and ‘what the heck I was thinking’ on repeat mode, followed by zero regrets and many surprises. I got some hints that statistics would be my calling during my Bachelor's studies at the University of Piraeus (Department of Statistics and Insurance Science). By the end of my studies, I was determined to pursue a Master's degree in Biostatistics, which I did at the same University and Department. Afterwards, and with the encouragement of my Master's supervisor (because the self-doubt emerged once again), I moved to Ioannina to pursue my PhD Studies at the School of Medicine (Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology). Little did I know that this step would be the springboard for my career as a researcher and more surprises to follow. I was introduced to evidence synthesis, particularly the network meta-analysis framework. I cannot remember what I found more intriguing: the network meta-analysis or the Bayesian framework. My research revolved around (aggregate) missing participant outcome data in network meta-analysis. 

Publications, international collaborations, journal clubs and presentations in conferences filled my experience canvas with unprecedented colours and set the foundation for my next big step: my relocation to Germany as a postdoctoral researcher. Of course, my 'buddy', self-doubt, relocated with me there. And, yes, ‘what the heck I was thinking’ was the initial theme on repeat mode. 

I am currently a [Privatdozentin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privatdozent) and principal investigator in evidence synthesis. 

His research interests include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He leads the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
